Developing lessons to ease teachers into time series data science, B04, Prof. Benjamin Smarr


**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

Choosing the target audience for our project has been the most fascinating topic discussed in my field thus far.  Should we concentrate on teaching data science to young professionals?  Students in high school are considering majoring in data science.  Are incoming UCSD data science majors in need of a program overview?  Or maybe everyone who wants to learn how to code in general? We also spoke about how these categories overlap and how to focus more precisely.  These questions influenced our research on data collection and generated a lot of suggestions about how we want to develop our finished product.  Should we utilize content from beginner data science courses, for instance?  How should the program be structured and paced?  These discussions made me realize how crucial it is to identify a precise target audience since it genuinely determines the course and result of a project.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

For the Quarter 2 assignment, I would like to look at the best ways to gamify our teachings.  How can we improve and sustain our product's user engagement?  Duolingo, which was created to educate Python and data science, served as our motivation.  In what similar ways can we make learning enjoyable and inspiring?  We can create our own interactive and captivating learning methodologies for our app by analyzing the strategies and design decisions that led to Duolingo's success.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

Developing our current Quarter 1 project as a mobile application instead of a web application is one possible modification I would make.  In order to help users during classes, I would also like to incorporate a live AI assistant.  A mobile version would increase accessibility, increase user engagement, and provide our team with useful app development expertise.  Our present AI workflow, which creates questions based on our curriculum, would be expanded upon by the AI assistant.  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) would be used to reference content from our collection and give users real-time guidance while they study.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Agent development is something I'd like to include in the project.  I imagine this being a part of the AI assistant workflow, though I'm not totally sure how it would fit.  My primary motivation is to learn how to create an agent from scratch and acquire new technological abilities.  It's a developing field in data science, and I want to use my capstone project to learn more about something that I've been very interested in.
