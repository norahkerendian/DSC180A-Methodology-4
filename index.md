Developing lessons to ease teachers into time series data science, B04, Prof. Benjamin Smarr

DRAFT 

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain so far has been the topic of deciding the audience of our project. Should we focus on an audience of young professionals who are looking to learn data science? What about an audience of high school students looking to see if they want to major in data science? What about incoming data science majors at UCSD to ease them into the rigorous data science curriculum? What about a more general audience of anyone who wants to learn how to code? What's the overlap between these audiences? How can we narrow our focus? These questions all sparked ideas as to how we even want to develop our final product. Also, this guides our research on data collection. Should we use material from Intro to Data Science courses? How should we split up the curriculum? These conversations were very interesting and made me realize the importance of having a set audience because it really drives the outcome.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation i would like to pursue for the quarter 2 project is looking more into the best way to gamify our lessons. How can we increase and keep engagement with our product? our inspiration for this project is to create something similar to duolingo, but instead for teaching python and data science. how can we think about presenting our material in a fun and engaging way? Looking more into the techniques and reasons behind certain aspects in duolingo could help us come up with our own methods to use in our app.  

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change I'd make to the approach taken in the current quarter 1 project is to make it into a mobile app rather than a web application. Also, creating an AI assistant to help the user live during their lessons. 

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
